# IgnoreAllAddon
A basic addon for World of Warcraft to introduce myself to the world of Lua and the Warcraft API. __IgnoreAll__ is a super lightweight addon that adds the `ia` and `iarm` commands, allowing a user to add or remove multiple users to/from your ignore list at once (with a single command).

## Installation:
* Clone the branch.
* As with all Warcraft addons, move main `IgnoreAll` folder into your `<WoW Directory>/Interface/Addons` folder.
* Run the game and check the addon if it is not already checked.

## Using the Addon:
* `/ia ` and `/ignoreall` are the default chat-line commands for setting a list of user to be ignored. Using either of these commands whilst a player is target will also add that player to your ignore list.
* `/iarm` and `/removeignore` are the default chat-line commands for removing a player from your ignore list.
* `/ia help` or `/iarm help` will repeat the above information in your chat-box.
